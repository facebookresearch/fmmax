### `basis.plane_wave_in_plane_wavevector`
Computes the in-plane wavevector for a plane-wave excitation.


#### Args:
- **wavelength** (None): The free-space wavelength of the plane-wave excitation.
- **polar_angle** (None): Polar angle of the plane-wave excitation.
- **azimuthal_angle** (None): Azimuthal angle of plane-wave the excitation.
- **permittivity** (None): Scalar permittivity of the medium in which the polar angle
and azimuthal angle are specified.

#### Returns:
- **None**: The fundamental transverse wavevector, i.e. `(kx0, ky0)`.
