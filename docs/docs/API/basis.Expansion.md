    ### `Class basis.Expansion():`
Stores the expansion.

The expansion consists of the integer coefficients of the reciprocal lattice vectors
used in the Fourier expansion of fields, permittivities, etc. in the FMM scheme.

#### Args:
- **basis_coefficients** (None): The integer coefficients of the primitive reciprocal lattice
vectors, which generate the full set of reciprocal-space vectors in the expansion.
- **num_terms** (None): The number of terms in the expansion.
