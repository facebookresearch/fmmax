    "# Introduction: simulating a periodic dipole\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will simulate a simple (periodic) dipole in vacuum. We'll compute important *real-space* quantities, like the light extraction efficiency and the integrated far-field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we'll examine how simulating structures using FMM is different than other discretization techniques (e.g. FDTD) as it expands both the fields and the structure on a *Fourier basis*. Since we typically describe our simulation structure in the *real-space* domain, there are various ways one can represent the structure on a Fourier basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also explore how to perform a *convergence check*, which is important for all numerical methods that attempt to discretize Maxwell's equations. In the context of FMM, this means gradually increasing the number of *Fourier terms* (or basis elements) and examining how some fundamental quantity (e.g. reflection, transmission) changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we show how we can visualize the steady-state field response in the *real-space* domain, even though it is computed in the Fourier domain."
