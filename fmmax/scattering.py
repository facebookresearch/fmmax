class ScatteringMatrix:
    """Stores the scattering matrix for a stack of layers.

    The first layer in a stack is the "start" layer, and the last layer in the
    stack is the "end" layer.

    The scattering matrix relates the forward-going and backward-going waves
    on the two sides of a layer stack, which are labeled `a` and `b` respectively.

    Note that forward going fields are defined at the *start* of a layer while
    backward-going fields are defined at the *end* of a layer, as depicted below.
    This is discussed near equation 4.1 in [1999 Whittaker].

                        b_0 <-                            b_N <-

    Following the convention of [1999 Whittaker], the terms a_N and b_0 are
    obtained from,

                    a_N = s11 @ a_0 + s12 @ b_N
                    b_0 = s21 @ a_0 + s22 @ b_N

    Besides the actual scattering matrix element, the `ScatteringMatrix` stores
    information about the start and end layers, which are needed to extend the
    scattering matrix to include more layers.

    Attributes:
        s11: Relates forward-going fields at start to forward-going fields at end.
        s12: Relates backward-going fields at end to forward-going fields at end.
        s21: Relates forward-going fields at start to backward-going fields at start.
        s22: Relates backward-going fields at end to backward-going fields at start.
        start_layer_solve_result: The eigensolve result for the start layer.
